      <h2>1. Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        At Team Zone 10, we strive to offer the highest quality fitness classes
        and services. However, we understand that unforeseen circumstances may
        arise. Our refund policy is outlined below.

        All membership purchases, including monthly, quarterly, or annual
        packages, are non-refundable once the package is activated. If you are
        unable to attend the classes for health reasons, we may offer a credit
        towards future services, subject to approval.
      </p>

      <h3>1.2 Trial Classes</h3>
      <p>
        Fees for trial classes are non-refundable. If you are unable to attend
        your scheduled trial class, please contact us at least 24 hours in
        advance to reschedule.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3 Special Events and Workshops</h3>
      <p>
        For any special events or workshops, we offer refunds if you cancel your
        reservation at least 48 hours before the event. Refund requests made
        after this time will not be accepted.
